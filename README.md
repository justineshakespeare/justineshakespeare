ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Justine Shakespeare. I recently completed the advanced graduate certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In this program I enhanced my skills in data analysis using R, statistical methods, research design, and survey methodology.

I'm interested in using GitHub to connect with fellow data analysts and R users, to discover new projects and code, and to further my R programming and quantitative analysis skills. See my portfolio [here](https://justineshakespeare.github.io/portfolio/).
