- 👋 Hi, I’m @justineshakespeare
- I recently completed the advanced graduate certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In this program I enhanced my skills in data analysis using R, statistical methods, research design, and survey methodology.
- I’m interested in furthering my skills in R programming and quantitative analysis.
