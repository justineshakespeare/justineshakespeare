- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @justineshakespeare
- I recently completed the advanced graduate certificate in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In this program I built my skills in data analytics using R, statistical methods, research design, and survey methodology.
- Iâ€™m interested in building on my R programming and statistical analysis skills.
